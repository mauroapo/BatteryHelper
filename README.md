# BatteryHelper
The way the code works is that it runs every minute to see if your battery is lower than 35% and if your charger isn't plugged. In the case that both are true it'll show you a notification that your battery is low.

# To install
First of all you need to install AutoHotKey https://www.autohotkey.com

```
git clone https://github.com/mauroapo/BatteryHelper.git
cd ./BatteryHelper pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After the installation you just need to run the runbat.ahk
